                            <h1 class="mb-4">What is Solar Energy ?</h1>
                            <p class="mb-4 pb-2">Solar energy is the radiation from the Sun capable of producing heat, causing chemical reactions, or generating electricity. The total amount of solar energy received on Earth is vastly more than the world's current and anticipated energy requirements. If suitably harnessed, solar energy has the potential to satisfy all future energy needs.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4 pb-2">More energy from the sun falls on the earth in one hour than is used by everyone in the world in one year. A variety of technologies convert sunlight to usable energy for buildings. The most commonly used solar technologies for homes and businesses are solar photovoltaics for electricity, passive solar design for space heating and cooling, and solar water heating.</p>
                            <p >Businesses and industry use solar technologies to diversify their energy sources, improve efficiency, and save money. Energy developers and utilities use solar photovoltaic and concentrating solar power technologies to produce electricity on a massive scale to power cities and small towns.</p>

                            <h6 class="text-primary">Evolution of solar energy</h6>
                            <h1 class="mb-4">History of Solar:</h1>
                            <p class="mb-4 pb-2">Studies of the history and development of solar technology lead one to comprehend how essential a role the sun has played in the evolution of mankind. Many ancient civilizations from Egypt, China, India, Africa, Greece, Rome, Mexico, South America, and Europe worshiped the sun as God, especially in societies that were primarily dependent on agriculture and believed the sun could grant prosperity and sustenance. The first sundial, the earliest type of timekeeping device, dates back to 3500 B.C. The Indian observatory Jantar Mantar features many instruments to measure the position and distances of extraterrestrial bodies along with the world’s largest sundial. Sun is the closest star to earth and offers an immense source of energy. Every hour of the day, earth receives around 430 Quintilian joules of energy from the sun and this energy would be sufficient to meet the global energy demands if harnessed as electricity. Over time, the humans have identified the sun not just as a deity but as a sustainable source of energy. The evolution of solar energy has been gradual and today, the solar industry has become a dominant source of renewable power. Though it is assumed by many that the idea of solar panels is a new age technology, the strategic use of the sun for heating and cooling was discovered around 2400 years ago. The Greek philosopher, Socrates observed a phenomenon called passive solar architecture to best utilize the rotation of Earth, where if strategically placed, the homes could get maximum sunlight during winter and minimal sunlight in summer. It has been nearly 200 years since the innovation of solar cells and the technology has been evolving ever since.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4 pb-2">The first meaningful step in solar technology with the discovery of photovoltaic effect happened in 1839 by Alexandre-Edmund Becquerel. It is the effect due to which light energy is converted to electric current in certain semiconductor materials when they are exposed to light. This 19-year-old French scientist was fascinated with the idea of the emission of light without heat (phosphorescence) and during his study of photo-chemical reaction, he started to understand the absorption of energy in the form of light, which eventually led him to the discovery of the photovoltaic effect. In 1861, Auguste Mouchout utilized solar thermal technology to power engines by converting solar energy into mechanical steam power. After the huge demand for coal during the Industrial Revolution, this French engineer and professor was curious to uncover new alternative energy sources and was granted the first solar patent for a steam engine powered by a solar reflective dish. Since the water power was not a portable energy, this was considered a considerable advance in alternative power generating. Solar thermal technology was further developed by John Ericsson, a Swiss-born engineer, in 1870. His design was an interesting variation of Mouchout’s work where he used a trough instead of a dish to reflect the sun’s rays. Unfortunately, he passed away without leaving any blueprints of his design, a design that would have been able to compete with the conventional generation techniques of that time.</p>
                            <p >Photoconductivity of selenium was discovered by Willoughby Smith in 1873, and the first solar cells were made from selenium in 1883 by American inventor Charles Fritts. The first photoelectric module was made by coating a metal plate with semiconductor selenium with a thin layer of semitransparent gold-leaf film. Fritts reported that despite the intensity of light, the current produced was continuous and of considerable force even though the energy conversion rate was noted to be only 1% to 2%. It was only by 1888 the first solar cell was built by Aleksandr Stoletov based on the outer photoelectric effect which explained why electrons emitted when sunlight was absorbed. Albert Einstein published a paper on the same which brought widespread attention towards solar power technology. He won the Nobel Prize in 1921 for his theories explaining photoelectric cell and quantum light hypothesis. Using this technology, Calvin Fuller, Gerald Pearson, and Darryl Chaplin who were the scientists at Bell Laboratories produced the first modern photovoltaic cell in 1954, where silicon semiconductors were used to convert sunlight into electricity. These cells later became the core of contemporary PV applications. The first generation solar technology could convert sunlight to electricity with only 6% efficiency. The PV panels consisted of wafer-based cells, which were made using materials like crystalline silicon. In 1955, solar cells were sold commercially for the first time by Hoffman Electronics. Vanguard 1, the first satellite to use solar cells, was launched in 1958. These solar cells were cost-effective for space exploration; however, they were not very efficient for terrestrial uses. Hoffman Electronics continued working on PV panels and created more efficient cells but the cells were only used in space flight for a long time. Solar cells were used on U.S. Space Station, Skylab that orbited the earth from 1973 to 1979. During this time period, solar panel technology was expensive for mainstream consumer distribution; however, as the technology continued to evolve, the cost started to decline. Dr. Elliot Berman contributed greatly in making solar panels affordable by using cost-effective materials. This shift in production reduced the price of solar panels, which in turn empowered solar panel technology to compete in the mainstream power market. Due to contributions from Solar Power Corporation, the efficiency of photovoltaic panels increased and the cost of the panels declined over time.</p>

                            <p >Photoconductivity of selenium was discovered by Willoughby Smith in 1873, and the first solar cells were made from selenium in 1883 by American inventor Charles Fritts. The first photoelectric module was made by coating a metal plate with semiconductor selenium with a thin layer of semitransparent gold-leaf film. Fritts reported that despite the intensity of light, the current produced was continuous and of considerable force even though the energy conversion rate was noted to be only 1% to 2%. It was only by 1888 the first solar cell was built by Aleksandr Stoletov based on the outer photoelectric effect which explained why electrons emitted when sunlight was absorbed. Albert Einstein published a paper on the same which brought widespread attention towards solar power technology. He won the Nobel Prize in 1921 for his theories explaining photoelectric cell and quantum light hypothesis. Using this technology, Calvin Fuller, Gerald Pearson, and Darryl Chaplin who were the scientists at Bell Laboratories produced the first modern photovoltaic cell in 1954, where silicon semiconductors were used to convert sunlight into electricity. These cells later became the core of contemporary PV applications. The first generation solar technology could convert sunlight to electricity with only 6% efficiency. The PV panels consisted of wafer-based cells, which were made using materials like crystalline silicon. In 1955, solar cells were sold commercially for the first time by Hoffman Electronics. Vanguard 1, the first satellite to use solar cells, was launched in 1958. These solar cells were cost-effective for space exploration; however, they were not very efficient for terrestrial uses. Hoffman Electronics continued working on PV panels and created more efficient cells but the cells were only used in space flight for a long time. Solar cells were used on U.S. Space Station, Skylab that orbited the earth from 1973 to 1979. During this time period, solar panel technology was expensive for mainstream consumer distribution; however, as the technology continued to evolve, the cost started to decline. Dr. Elliot Berman contributed greatly in making solar panels affordable by using cost-effective materials. This shift in production reduced the price of solar panels, which in turn empowered solar panel technology to compete in the mainstream power market. Due to contributions from Solar Power Corporation, the efficiency of photovoltaic panels increased and the cost of the panels declined over time.</p>
                            <p >surface area and some the materials used were noted to be harmful and toxic under certain environmental conditions or during recycling, posing a challenge to design non-polluting PV panels and making them less environment-friendly.
                                Research and developments continued into the 21st century in the laboratory environments. Changes to the environment increased the need for sustainable energy generation and motivated scientists to put in greater effort into creating highly efficient and commercially viable PV technology. This third generation of solar technology incorporates multiple solar energy technology, including organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells that aim to provide better efficiency while reducing the overall environmental impact of solar panels. PolyPower technology was developed at a nano level to provide a lightweight, flexible and potentially inexpensive approach to solar energy harvesting. In the earlier years, PV panels have been largely limited due to their physical properties. With the use of nano technology, this generation can overcome these challenges and open a world of possibilities. MIT researchers produced ultra-slim, flexible solar cells in 2016. This advancement is still in its early phases but could help widen the use of solar technology in the near future. Continued scientific advancements have made extensive advancements in solar panel technology. The most important factor in panel technology is that the more energy a solar panel absorbs, the more efficient the panel becomes at converting solar energy into electricity. Today, solar panels can deliver at up to 22% efficiency and there have been ongoing efforts to make solar energy even more affordable and efficient.
                                As a developing nation, India has tremendous potential for generating clean electricity through Renewable Energy Sources (RES) namely Hydro, Bioenergy, Wind and Solar. The country has consciously been trying to reduce carbon footprint by promoting clean energy launched by Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission, which is one of the eight missions under National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC–2008). Being a tropical country, India’s geography allows many regions to receive almost 300 sunny days in a year. The combination of abundant sunshine and the large population in the country makes our country an ideal location for solar market. In a country like ours, various factors like income generation, social development, and health issues influence the demand for sufficient resources. Historically, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions used to be significantly more for the developed economies as compared to the developing countries; however, recent studies suggest that this trend is changing now and is taking an opposite turn. An overwhelmingly large number of private corporations have ventured into the solar PV sector for installations and development throughout various states of the country. Global solar market requires more support from the Governments and if the countries can adjust their polices to make solar equipment more affordable to consumers and encourage renewable energy growth, solar can be expected to dominate the market space over the next decade.

With the way the cost of solar has plummeted in the past decade, it’s easy to forget that going solar had a completely different meaning even just 15 years ago. Let’s go back a few centuries to the origins of solar PV and explore the history of solar energy and silicon solar technology.</p>

                            <h1 class="mb-4">When was solar energy first used?</h1>
                            <p >In theory, solar energy was used by humans as early as 7th century B.C. when history tells us that humans used sunlight to light fires with magnifying glass materials. Later, in 3rd century B.C., the Greeks and Romans were known to harness solar power with mirrors to light torches for religious ceremonies. These mirrors became a normalized tool referred to as “burning mirrors.” Chinese civilization documented the use of mirrors for the same purpose later in 20 A.D.
                                Another early use for solar energy that is still popular today was the concept of “sunrooms” in buildings. These sunrooms used massive windows to direct sunlight into one concentrated area. Some of the iconic Roman bathhouses, typically those situated on the south-facing side of buildings, were sunrooms. Later in the 1200s A.D., ancestors to the Pueblo Native Americans known as the Anasazi situated themselves in south-facing abodes on cliffs to capture the sun’s warmth during cold winter months.
                            </p>
                            <p>In the late 1700s and 1800s, researchers and scientists had success using sunlight to power ovens for long voyages. They also harnessed the power of the sun to produce solar-powered steamboats. Ultimately, it’s clear that even thousands of years before the era of solar panels, the concept of manipulating the power of the sun was a common practice.</p>

                            <p ><h3>Solar panels in outer space</h3>Some of the earliest uses of solar technology were actually in outer space where solar was used to power satellites. In 1958, the Vanguard I satellite used a tiny one-watt panel to power its radios. Later that year the Vanguard II, Explorer III and Sputnik-3 were all launched with PV technology on board. In 1964, NASA was responsible for launching the first Nimbus spacecraft, a satellite able to run entirely on a 470 watt solar array. In 1966, NASA launched the world’s first Orbiting Astronomical Observatory, powered by a one-kilowatt array.
                            <p ><h3>First solar residence</h3>In 1973, the University of Delaware was responsible for constructing the first solar building, named “Solar One.” The system ran on a hybrid supply of solar thermal and solar PV power. It was also the first instance of building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) – the array didn’t use solar panels but instead had solar integrated into the rooftop, similar to the design for Tesla’s new roof product.
                            <p ><h3>Achievements in solar conversion efficiency</h3>Between 1957 and 1960, Hoffman Electronics made a number of breakthroughs with photovoltaic efficiency, improving the efficiency record from 8% to 14%. The next major achievement was in 1985 when the University of South Wales achieved 20% efficiency for silicon cells. In 1999, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory collaborated with SpectroLab Inc. to create a solar cell with 33.3% efficiency. The University of South Wales
